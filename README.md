# MPC-for-Steering-autonomous-vehicles
A technical report and simulation of the paper: Development of a Genetic-Algorithm-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Scheme on Velocity and Steering of Autonomous Vehicles. Simulated the controller in MATLAB which tries to track the desired trajectory by minimizing cost function using Genetic algorithm as the optimization technique.
